# County-Cover-Crop-Adoption-And-Disadoption

In this project, we use the Agricultural Censuses (USDA NASS) from 2012, 2017 and 2022 to investigate the role of government programs, 
climate conditions and other variables on county cover crop adoption and disadoption thorugh the lens of U.S. regions.
Besides the Census information, we gather climate data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA), the federal crop insurance premium 
subsidies from the Risk Management Agency (RMA), and citizens' climate opinion from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communications.<br>
